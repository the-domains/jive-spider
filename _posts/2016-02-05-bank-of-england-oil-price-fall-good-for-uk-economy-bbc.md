description: "The fall in oil prices has been a \"net good\" for the economy, Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has said. He told BBC Radio 5live's Wake Up To Money that falling oil prices had helped to push up wages in real terms. Mr Broadbent also said the UK was enjoying a \"solid\" recovery but he added there was \"no great urgency\" to put up interest rates."
