# Creamy mushroom, garlic and cracked black peppercorn steak sauce.

* Melt some butter in a pan on a low heat.
* Mix in a tablespoon and a half of strong white flour.
* Slice some mushrooms into a glass bowl with a beef stock cube and cover with boiling water-mix gently until the cube dissolves.
* Pour the mushroom/stock into the pan with the flour/butter mix(called a roux) and keep stirring over a LOW heat. If it gets a bit too thick then add a bit more water as you go.
* Add cracked black peppercorns and dried garlic to your own taste -but don't taste too much as it is going to go all over that lovely ribeye.
