Also on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron will address the annual conference of business lobbying group, the CBI.

He will say that the spending review, which sets out where government cuts will fall over the next five years, will be about putting the security of UK families first.

"By making the further savings we need over the course of this parliament, we can prioritise what matters for working families - schools, the NHS and our national security," Mr Cameron is expected to say.
