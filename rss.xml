            <description><![CDATA[<p>Spending review: George Osborne 'secures deals' on 30% cuts 3 hours ago  From the section UK Image copyrightGetty Images Image caption Mr Osborne will reveal his spending review later in the month Four government departments have provisionally agreed to cut their spending by an average of 30% over the next four years, Chancellor George Osborne is to announce later. The transport, local government and environment departments, plus the Treasury, have all agreed deals ahead of the spending review on 25 November. The cuts will help the public finances back into surplus, he will say. A Treasury source told BBC News the agreements were "really good progress". Spending review: Nine new prisons to replace old jails 'Confidence risk' The departments will be expected to cut day-to-day spending over the next four years through a combination of efficiency savings and closing low value programmes. Negotiations are continuing with others, the source added. No-one knows what the next economic crisis to hit our world will be, or when it will come. But we know we haven't abolished boom and bust George Osborne, Chancellor The chancellor has asked most parts of the government to come up with savings of between 25% and 40% by the end of the current parliament. A number of departments, including health and overseas aid, have had their budgets protected. In a speech later in London, Mr Osborne will warn that if the government does not control spending there is a risk of loss of confidence in the economy. "The deficit could bring our country down," he will say. "While debt is high, our economic security is in danger. "No-one knows what the next economic crisis to hit our world will be, or when it will come. But we know we haven't abolished boom and bust." 'Resisting attempts' One department which has not yet reached an agreement is the Department for Work and Pensions, from where Mr Osborne is seeking £12bn in welfare savings. The chancellor is currently seeking new ways to save £4bn after the House of Lords rejected legislation paving the way for working tax credit cuts. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is strongly resisting attempts by the Treasury to make Universal Credit less generous, the BBC understands. Image copyrightPA Universal Credit is a new type of benefit designed to support people who are on a low income or out of work. It is replacing six existing benefits - income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit, and housing benefit. Resigning matter? But Treasury officials are thought to be considering increasing the penalties faced by claimants who take extra work. It has prompted speculation over whether Mr Duncan Smith might resign over the row. But asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if Mr Duncan Smith would leave, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: "I don't think so." Image copyrightReuters Image caption Mr Cameron is to say the forthcoming spending review will protect working families Also on Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron will address the annual conference of business lobbying group, the CBI. He will say that the spending review, which sets out where government cuts will fall over the next five years, will be about putting the security of UK families first. "By making the further savings we need over the course of this parliament, we can prioritise what matters for working families - schools, the NHS and our national security," Mr Cameron is expected to say.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Premiership: Wasps 23-3 Gloucester  From the section Rugby Union Share this page   David Halaifonua was sent off by Ian Tempest for a high and late tackle in the second half Wasps (16) 23 Tries: Wade, Penalty try Cons: Jackson (2) Pens: Daly (3) Gloucester (0) 3 Pen: Laidlaw Relive Sunday's Premiership rugby Wasps dominated Gloucester to record their second Premiership home win of the season as both sides had a man sent off at the Ricoh Arena.  Gloucester wing David Halaifonua was shown red for a high and late tackle before Wasps prop Lorenzo Cittadini punched Billy Twelvetrees off the ball.  Wasps winger Christian Wade burst through the visiting defence at pace for the only try of the first half.  A penalty try followed after the break as Elliot Daly also kicked nine points.  Gloucester had to wait until the 49th minute for their only score of the game as Scotland scrum-half Greig Laidlaw kicked a penalty on his first appearance of the season.  By then, the Cherry and Whites were already 16 points behind after Wade's early try and two long-range penalties from Daly before Halaifonua's dismissal had them a man down.  Referee Ian Tempest and the television match official ruled foul play against his challenge on second-row Bradley Davies and things were soon to get worse for the visitors.  George Smith marshalled a driving maul to the line for Wasps, which Gloucester collapsed illegally and a penalty try was awarded.  Fly-half Ruaridh Jackson kicked the extras, but Wasps also had to see out the remaining minutes with 14 men.  Tight-head Cittadini was sent off after replays showed his fist had caught Gloucester captain Twelvetrees around the throat as the pair wrestled for possession.  Wasps closed the game out for their second win in the opening four rounds while Gloucester's first away defeat of the season saw them drop to ninth, a place below the victors.   Lorenzo Cittadini was sent off for Wasps in the closing minutes for foul play Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said:  "We made seven line-breaks but didn't take enough of them. We're creating opportunities but our conversion rate isn't good enough.  "We would have taken this result before the game. We had the game won after 60 minutes but we didn't kick on.  "From the side we looked to have switched off in the last 20 minutes as we lacked accuracy and our discipline faded."  On Lorenzo Cittadini's dismissal:  "I haven't had a good look at it. The referee had a good game and it's not my view that counts."  Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys said:  "We just couldn't score. We were on the other end of a penalty try award and should have definitely had one from a scrum in the second half but that wouldn't have changed the result.  "Large parts of our game were good. Our set piece was excellent and it's ironic that the parts we were good at last year fell away today whereas some of the weaker areas were strong.  "We stuck at it and kept working but we didn't kick well enough in the first half. They got into our half on only four occasions with Elliot Daly kicking three super goals and they scored a fantastic try."  Wasps: Piutau; Halai, Daly, Jacobs, Wade; Jackson, Simpson; McIntyre, Festuccia, Cittadini, Launchbury, Davies, Haskell (capt), Smith, Hughes.  Replacements: Johnson, Bristow, Cooper-Woolley, Gaskell, Thompson, Robson, Lozowski, Tagicakibau.  Sent off: Cittadini (74).  Gloucester: Sharples; Halaifonua, Twelvetrees (capt), Hook, May; Burns, Laidlaw; McAllister, Hibbard, Afoa, Savage, Stooke, Kalamafoni, Kvesic, Morgan.  Replacements: Brooker, Thomas, Doran-Jones, Moriarty, Rowan, Heinz, Purdy, Cook.  Sent off: Halaifonua (46).  Att: 11,649  Ref: Ian Tempest (RFU).
